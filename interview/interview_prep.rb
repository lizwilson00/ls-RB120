# question 1
# class Student
#   attr_reader :id

#   def initialize(name)
#     @name = name

#   end

#   def id=(value)

#   end
# end

# tom = Student.new("Tom")
# p tom.id = 45

# question 2
# Constructor method that initializes 2 instance variables.
# Instance method that outputs an interpolated string of those variables.
# Getter methods for both (you can use the shorthand notation if you want).
# Prevent instances from accessing these methods outside of the class.
# Finally, explain what concept(s) youâ€™ve just demonstrated with your code.

# class Person
#   def initialize(name, age)
#     @name = name

# Class variables with inheritance
# The class variable is shared across all classes 
# When a subclass initializes the class variable differently than
# the superclass, that value will be returned for all calls
# to the class variable

# question 16

#     "Hi, my name is Dylan and I have #{color} hair."

# puts Human.new("Jo").hair_color("blonde")  
# # Should output "Hi, my name is Jo and I have blonde hair."

# puts Human.hair_color("")
